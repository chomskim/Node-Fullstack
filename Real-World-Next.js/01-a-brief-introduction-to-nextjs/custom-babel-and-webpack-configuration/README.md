## Custom Babel and Webpack Configuration Example

Next.js example for the "**Custom Babel and Webpack Configuration Example**" section of **Real World Next.js**.

## Running the example

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can edit the `pages/index.js` file, add more pages and take advantage of the [experimental pipeline operator](https://github.com/valtech-nyc/proposal-fsharp-pipelines) thanks to the custom Babel configuration.

Feel free to use this project for adding more and more Babel plugins, just to get familiar with this JavaScript transcompiler.
